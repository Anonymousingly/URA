These images describe the summary of algorithm.
This algorithm is very simple.
It uses the concept of tracking index updates on a node using a variable named as vMFactor .
<b>Image 12 </b>also describes the limitations and properties of those limited data-structures that can be used as BaseStructure 
for URA(Undelayed Random Allgorithm.)
